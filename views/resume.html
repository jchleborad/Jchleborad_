                    <p>
                        One of the challenges facing future graduates is connecting with the right people and selling themselves and their skills
                        to potential employers. Many of the students I work with come from completely different industries,
                        embarking on a career in an unfamiliar environment. I love learning how and why they came about their
                        current path and helping them with all aspects of their career planning. From resume development
                        and job search techniques, online and personal networking, to decision making skills. It is an extremely
                        fulfilling experience watching as their lives transform into the dream they have worked so hard to
                        achieve. As a former Software Development student myself, I am able to share my own experiences;
                        how I was able to achieve my goals and what obstacles I overcame on the way. This gives me a unique
                        perspective, helping bridge a gap and allowing me to develop a strong relationship with them from
                        the beginning. My success as a Career Advisor has been very rewarding both professionally and personally.
